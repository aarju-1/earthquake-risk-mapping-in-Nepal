# Earthquake Risk Mapping Project
This project analyzes and visualizes earthquake hazard  and risk in Nepal using geospatial data, Python, and interactive mapping tools. The goal of this project is to map earthquake intensity using earthquake event from past 30 years of Nepal.

Deliverables  of this project are:

    Mapping earthquake hazard intensity using raster data.

    Estimating population exposure per district from population rasters.

    Calculating  a risk index combining hazard and exposure.

    Building interactive maps to visualize hazard, exposure, and risk.

Tools and Libraries Used:
    Python

    Jupyter Notebook

    GeoPandas

    RasterStats

    Pandas

    Matplotlib

    Folium

    QGIS

Limitations:

        Large pixel size in raster data reduces spatial accuracy, especially in densely populated or small districts.
        
        Population raster represents estimates, not exact census values.

        Risk index is simplified (hazard Ã— exposure) and does not account for building vulnerability or resilience.
